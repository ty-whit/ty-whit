Hi, Iâ€™m Tyler. ðŸ‘‹
I am a Data Engineer. I build data pipeline. I like making sure that people have the data and knowledge to answer their questions.

I'm intersted in working with and learning about tools that clean and transform data to be more consumable, that check data quality, or facilitate moving it from point A to point B. Right now, that's mostly Databricks and Pyspark. 

## Things I'm learning 
- Databricks/Pyspark
- Data Science/Machine Learning
- Cloud infrastructure
- Mathematics/Statistics
- Web Development

## Personal Projets in progress (A.K.A development hell)
- Quartz Blog
- HTML Website for wife
- Grocery Inventory
- Untitled Space Shooter Game

Hi, Iâ€™m Tyler. ðŸ‘‹
I am a Data Engineer at Summit Consulting. I build data pipeline. I like making sure that people have the data and knowledge to answer their questions.

I'm intersted in working on tools that clean and transform data to be more consumable, that check data quality, or facilitate moving it from point A to point B. 

## Personal Projets in progress (A.K.A development hell)
- Grocery Inventory
- Untitled Space Shooter Game

## Things I'm learning 
- Data Science/Machine Learning
- Mathematics/Statistics
- Web Development
